          This is a rather new concept method in the car wash industry, which has been wecomed in many parts of the world thanks to its Eco-friendliness and effectiveness, although it has been used in the cleaning industy for decades thanks to its efficient cleaning
          and sterilizing power. For example, steam is a well-known method of carpet and upholstery cleaning, steam readily dissoves deposit on polluted surfaces, steam can be used to clean cars exterior and interior, it is completely safe on surfaces and
          upholstery and has, proven sanitizing and deodorizing effects. The most special feature of steam car clean is its Ecofriendliness. Steam takes very little water (less than 1 gallon per vehicle by average), and it does not cause any waste-water

      <h1>Waterless Car Cleaning</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        This unique product contains substantive polymers which bond to the paint and protect it during the wash. Therefore, No Rinse Wash & Shine offers greater protection and lubricity than conventional car washes leaving a sleek & glossy finish behind afterwards.

      </p>
      <p>
          More than ever, the water shortage problem is now a global issue! Old-school driveway washing uses 80 - 140 gallons of water and leads to water pollution. Waterless car washing is the new alternative to traditional car cleaning methods. No water is needed
          other than our spray-on/wipe off clean and polish products. Our way of car cleaning does not cause any wastewater run-off.
      </p>

      <h1>Cleaning Applications</h1>
      <p>
          The steam generated by the Steamer is hot enough to ligt off any grease and sollage, produces enough pressure to break down dirt, and is gentle enough to not damage the surface. In less time than a traditional car wash, the Steamer not only throughly
          washes your vehicle, but also sanitizes the interior and refurbishes greasy engine parts anew. It can even reach the tightest spaces and fittings that would otherwise be completely inaccessible with a pressure washer.
